        Resample this line into sections.

        The first point in the resampled line corresponds
        to the first point in the original line.

        Starting from the first point in the original line, a line
        segment is defined as the line connecting the last point in the
        resampled line and the next point in the original line.
        The line segment is then split into sections of length equal to
        ``section_length``. The resampled line is obtained
        by concatenating all sections.

        The number of sections in a line segment is calculated as follows:
        ``round(segment_length / section_length)``.

        Note that the resulting line has a length that is an exact multiple of
        ``section_length``, therefore its length is in general smaller
        or greater (depending on the rounding) than the length
        of the original line.

        For a straight line, the difference between the resulting length
        and the original length is at maximum half of the ``section_length``.
        For a curved line, the difference my be larger,
        because of corners getting cut.

.. _version-1.4.1:

1.4.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-26 04:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* 1.4.0 broke the producer pool, resulting in new connections being
  established for every acquire.


.. _version-1.4.0:

1.4.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-22 05:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* Adds module :mod:`kombu.mixins`.

    This module contains a :class:`~kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin` class
    that can be used to easily implement a message consumer
    thread that consumes messages from one or more
    :class:`kombu.messaging.Consumer` instances.

* New example: :ref:`task-queue-example`

    Using the ``ConsumerMixin``, default channels and
    the global connection pool to demonstrate new Kombu features.

* MongoDB transport did not work with MongoDB >= 2.0 (Issue #66)

    Fix contributed by James Turk.

* Redis-py version check did not account for beta identifiers
  in version string.

    Fix contributed by David Ziegler.

* Producer and Consumer now accepts a connection instance as the
  first argument.

    The connections default channel will then be used.

    In addition shortcut methods has been added to BrokerConnection::

        >>> connection.Producer(exchange)
        >>> connection.Consumer(queues=..., callbacks=...)

* BrokerConnection has aquired a ``connected`` attribute that
  can be used to check if the connection instance has established
  a connection.

* ``ConnectionPool.acquire_channel`` now returns the connections
  default channel rather than establising a new channel that
  must be manually handled.

* Added ``kombu.common.maybe_declare``

    ``maybe_declare(entity)`` declares an entity if it has
    not previously been declared in the same process.

* :func:`kombu.compat.entry_to_queue` has been moved to :mod:`kombu.common`

* New module :mod:`kombu.clocks` now contains an implementation
  of Lamports logical clock.

.. _version-1.3.5:

1.3.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-16 06:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* Python 3: AMQP_PROTOCOL_HEADER must be bytes, not str.

.. _version-1.3.4:

1.3.4
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-16 06:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* Fixes syntax error in pools.reset


.. _version-1.3.3:

1.3.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-15 02:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* pools.reset did not support after forker arguments.

.. _version-1.3.2:

1.3.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-10 01:00 P.M BST
:by: Mher Movsisyan

* Broke Python 2.5 compatibility by importing ``parse_qsl`` from ``urlparse``

* Connection.default_channel is now closed when connection is revived
  after connection failures.

* Pika: Channel now supports the ``connection.client`` attribute
  as required by the simple interface.

* pools.set_limit now raises an exception if the limit is lower
  than the previous limit.

* pools.set_limit no longer resets the pools.

.. _version-1.3.1:

1.3.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-07 03:00 P.M BST

* Last release broke after fork for pool reinitialization.

* Producer/Consumer now has a ``connection`` attribute,
  giving access to the :class:`BrokerConnection` of the
  instance.

* Pika: Channels now have access to the underlying
  :class:`BrokerConnection` instance using ``channel.connection.client``.

    This was previously required by the ``Simple`` classes and is now
    also required by :class:`Consumer` and :class:`Producer`.

* Connection.default_channel is now closed at object revival.

* Adds kombu.clocks.LamportClock.

* compat.entry_to_queue has been moved to new module :mod:`kombu.common`.

.. _version-1.3.0:

1.3.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-05 01:00 P.M BST

* Broker connection info can be now be specified using URLs

    The broker hostname can now be given as an URL instead, of the format::

        transport://user:password@hostname:port/virtual_host

    for example the default broker is expressed as::

        >>> BrokerConnection("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//")

    Transport defaults to amqp, and is not required.
    user, password, port and virtual_host is also not mandatory and
    will default to the corresponding transports default.

    .. note::

        Note that the path component (virtual_host) always starts with a
        forward-slash.  This is necessary to distinguish between the virtual
        host '' (empty) and '/', which are both acceptable virtual host names.

        A virtual host of '/' becomes:

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//

        and a virtual host of '' (empty) becomes::

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/

        So the leading slash in the path component is **always required**.

* Now comes with default global connection and producer pools.

    The acquire a connection using the connection parameters
    from a :class:`BrokerConnection`::

        >>> from kombu import BrokerConnection, connections
        >>> connection = BrokerConnection("amqp://guest:guest@localhost//")
        >>> with connections[connection].acquire(block=True):
        ...     # do something with connection

    To acquire a producer using the connection parameters
    from a :class:`BrokerConnection`::

        >>> from kombu import BrokerConnection, producers
        >>> connection = BrokerConnection("amqp://guest:guest@localhost//")
        >>> with producers[connection].acquire(block=True):
        ...     producer.publish({"hello": "world"}, exchange="hello")

    Acquiring a producer will in turn also acquire a connection
    from the associated pool in ``connections``, so you the number
    of producers is bound the same limit as number of connections.

    The default limit of 100 connections per connection instance
    can be changed by doing::

        >>> from kombu import pools
        >>> pools.set_limit(10)

    The pool can also be forcefully closed by doing::

        >>> from kombu import pools
        >>> pool.reset()

* SQS Transport: Persistence using SimpleDB is now disabled by default,
  after reports of unstable SimpleDB connections leading to errors.

* :class:`Producer` can now be used as a context manager.

* ``Producer.__exit__`` now properly calls ``release`` instead of close.

    The previous behavior would lead to a memory leak when using
    the :class:`kombu.pools.ProducerPool`

* Now silences all exceptions from `import ctypes` to match behaviour
  of the standard Python uuid module, and avoid passing on MemoryError
  exceptions on SELinux-enabled systems (Issue #52 + Issue #53)

* ``amqp`` is now an alias to the ``amqplib`` transport.

* ``kombu.syn.detect_environment`` now returns 'default', 'eventlet', or
  'gevent' depending on what monkey patches have been installed.

* Serialization registry has new attribute ``type_to_name`` so it is
  possible to lookup serializater name by content type.

* Exchange argument to ``Producer.publish`` can now be an :class:`Exchange`
  instance.

* ``compat.Publisher`` now supports the ``channel`` keyword argument.

* Acking a message on some transports could lead to :exc:`KeyError` being
  raised (Issue #57).

* Connection pool:  Connections are no long instantiated when the pool is
  created, but instantiated as needed instead.

* Tests now pass on PyPy.

* ``Connection.as_uri`` now includes the password if the keyword argument
  ``include_password`` is set.

* Virtual transports now comes with a default ``default_connection_params``
  attribute.

.. _version-1.2.1:

1.2.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-07-29 12:52 P.M BST

* Now depends on amqplib >= 1.0.0.

* Redis: Now automatically deletes auto_delete queues at ``basic_cancel``.

* ``serialization.unregister`` added so it is possible to remove unwanted
  seralizers.

* Fixes MemoryError while importing ctypes on SELinux (Issue #52).

* ``BrokerConnection.autoretry`` is a version of ``ensure`` that works
  with arbitrary functions (i.e. it does not need an associated object
  that implements the ``revive`` method.

  Example usage:

  .. code-block:: python

        channel = connection.channel()
        try:
            ret, channel = connection.autoretry(send_messages, channel=channel)
        finally:
            channel.close()

* ``ConnectionPool.acquire`` no longer force establishes the connection.

    The connection will be established as needed.

* ``BrokerConnection.ensure`` now supports an ``on_revive`` callback
  that is applied whenever the connection is re-established.

* ``Consumer.consuming_from(queue)`` returns True if the Consumer is
  consuming from ``queue``.

* ``Consumer.cancel_by_queue`` did not remove the queue from ``queues``.

* ``compat.ConsumerSet.add_queue_from_dict`` now automatically declared
  the queue if ``auto_declare`` set.

.. _version-1.2.0:

1.2.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-07-15 12:00 P.M BST

* Virtual: Fixes cyclic reference in Channel.close (Issue #49).

* Producer.publish: Can now set additional properties using keyword
  arguments (Issue #48).

* Adds Queue.no_ack option to control the no_ack option for individual queues.

* Recent versions broke pylibrabbitmq support.

* SimpleQueue and SimpleBuffer can now be used as contexts.

* Test requirements specifies PyYAML==3.09 as 3.10 dropped Python 2.4 support

* Now properly reports default values in Connection.info/.as_uri

.. _version-1.1.6:

1.1.6
=====
:release-date: 2011-06-13 04:00 P.M BST

* Redis: Fixes issue introduced in 1.1.4, where a redis connection
  failure could leave consumer hanging forever.

* SQS: Now supports fanout messaging by using SimpleDB to store routing
  tables.

    This can be disabled by setting the `supports_fanout` transport option:

        >>> BrokerConnection(transport="SQS",
        ...                  transport_options={"supports_fanout": False})

* SQS: Now properly deletes a message when a message is acked.

* SQS: Can now set the Amazon AWS region, by using the ``region``
  transport option.

* amqplib: Now uses `localhost` as default hostname instead of raising an
  error.

.. _version-1.1.5:

1.1.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-06-07 06:00 P.M BST

* Fixes compatibility with redis-py 2.4.4.

.. _version-1.1.4:

1.1.4
=====
:release-date: 2011-06-07 04:00 P.M BST

* Redis transport: Now requires redis-py version 2.4.4 or later.

* New Amazon SQS transport added.

    Usage:

        >>> conn = BrokerConnection(transport="SQS",
        ...                         userid=aws_access_key_id,
        ...                         password=aws_secret_access_key)

    The environment variables :envvar:`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    :envvar:`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are also supported.

* librabbitmq transport: Fixes default credentials support.

* amqplib transport: Now supports `login_method` for SSL auth.

    :class:`BrokerConnection` now supports the `login_method`
    keyword argument.

    Default `login_method` is ``AMQPLAIN``.

.. _version-1.1.3:

1.1.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-21 16:00 P.M CEST

* Redis: Consuming from multiple connections now works with Eventlet.

* Redis: Can now perform channel operations while the channel is in
  BRPOP/LISTEN mode (Issue #35).

    Also the async BRPOP now times out after 1 second, this means that
    cancelling consuming from a queue/starting consuming from additional queues
    has a latency of up to one second (BRPOP does not support subsecond
    timeouts).

* Virtual: Allow channel objects to be closed multiple times without error.

* amqplib: ``AttributeError`` has been added to the list of known
  connection related errors (:attr:`Connection.connection_errors`).

* amqplib: Now converts :exc:`SSLError` timeout errors to
  :exc:`socket.timeout` (http://bugs.python.org/issue10272)

* Ensures cyclic references are destroyed when the connection is closed.

.. _version-1.1.2:

1.1.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-06 16:00 P.M CEST

* Redis: Fixes serious issue where messages could be lost.

    The issue could happen if the message exceeded a certain number
    of kilobytes in size.

    It is recommended that all users of the Redis transport should
    upgrade to this version, even if not currently experiencing any
    issues.

.. _version-1.1.1:

1.1.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-05 15:51 P.M CEST

* 1.1.0 started using ``Queue.LifoQueue`` which is only available
  in Python 2.6+ (Issue #33).  We now ship with our own LifoQueue.


.. _version-1.1.0:

1.1.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-05 01:05 P.M CEST

.. _v110-important:

Important Notes
---------------

* Virtual transports: Message body is now base64 encoded by default
  (Issue #27).

    This should solve problems sending binary data with virtual
    transports.

    Message compatibility is handled by adding a ``body_encoding``
    property, so messages sent by older versions is compatible
    with this release.  However -- If you are accessing the messages
    directly not using Kombu, then you have to respect
    the ``body_encoding`` property.

    If you need to disable base64 encoding then you can do so
    via the transport options::

        BrokerConnection(transport="...",
                         transport_options={"body_encoding": None})

    **For transport authors**:

        You don't have to change anything in your custom transports,
        as this is handled automatically by the base class.

        If you want to use a different encoder you can do so by adding
        a key to ``Channel.codecs``.  Default encoding is specified
        by the ``Channel.body_encoding`` attribute.

        A new codec must provide two methods: ``encode(data)`` and
        ``decode(data)``.

* ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Setting ``limit=None`` (or 0)
  now disables pool semantics, and will establish and close
  the resource whenever acquired or released.

* ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Is now using a LIFO queue
  instead of the previous FIFO behavior.

    This means that the last resource released will be the one
    acquired next.  I.e. if only a single thread is using the pool
    this means only a single connection will ever be used.

* BrokerConnection: Cloned connections did not inherit transport_options
  (``__copy__``).

* contrib/requirements is now located in the top directory
  of the distribution.

* MongoDB: Now supports authentication using the ``userid`` and ``password``
  arguments to :class:`BrokerConnection` (Issue #30).

* BrokerConnection: Default autentication credentials are now delegated to
  the individual transports.
 
    This means that the ``userid`` and ``password`` arguments to
    BrokerConnection is no longer *guest/guest* by default.

    The amqplib and pika transports will still have the default
    credentials.

* :meth:`Consumer.__exit__` did not have the correct signature (Issue #32).

* Channel objects now have a ``channel_id`` attribute.

* MongoDB: Version sniffing broke with development versions of
	mongod (Issue #29).

* New environment variable :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION` will now emit debug
  log messages for connection related actions.

  :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` will also enable :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION`.

.. _version-1.0.7:

1.0.7
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-28 05:45 P.M CEST

* Now depends on anyjson 0.3.1

    cjson is no longer a recommended json implementation, and anyjson
    will now emit a deprecation warning if used.

* Please note that the Pika backend only works with version 0.5.2.

    The latest version (0.9.x) drastically changed API, and it is not
    compatible yet.

* on_decode_error is now called for exceptions in message_to_python
  (Issue #24).

* Redis: did not respect QoS settings.

* Redis: Creating a connection now ensures the connection is established.

    This means ``BrokerConnection.ensure_connection`` works properly with
    Redis.

* consumer_tag argument to ``Queue.consume`` can't be :const:`None`
  (Issue #21).

    A None value is now automatically converted to empty string.
    An empty string will make the server generate a unique tag.

* BrokerConnection now supports a ``transport_options`` argument.

    This can be used to pass additional arguments to transports.

* Pika: ``drain_events`` raised :exc:`socket.timeout` even if no timeout
  set (Issue #8).

.. version-1.0.6:

1.0.6
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-22 04:00 P.M CET

* The ``delivery_mode`` aliases (persistent/transient) were not automatically
  converted to integer, and would cause a crash if using the amqplib
  transport.

* Redis: The redis-py :exc:`InvalidData` exception suddenly changed name to
  :exc:`DataError`.

* The :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` environment variable can now be set to log all
  channel method calls.

  Support for the following environment variables have been added:

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CHANNEL` will wrap channels in an object that
      logs every method call.

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` both enables channel logging and configures the
      root logger to emit messages to standard error.

    **Example Usage**::

        $ KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG=1 python
        >>> from kombu import BrokerConnection
        >>> conn = BrokerConnection()
        >>> channel = conn.channel()
        Start from server, version: 8.0, properties:
            {u'product': 'RabbitMQ',..............  }
        Open OK! known_hosts []
        using channel_id: 1
        Channel open
        >>> channel.queue_declare("myq", passive=True)
        [Kombu channel:1] queue_declare('myq', passive=True)
        (u'myq', 0, 1)

.. _version-1.0.5:

1.0.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-17 04:00 P.M CET

* Fixed memory leak when creating virtual channels.  All virtual transports
  affected (redis, mongodb, memory, django, sqlalchemy, couchdb, beanstalk).

* Virtual Transports: Fixed potential race condition when acking messages.

    If you have been affected by this, the error would show itself as an
    exception raised by the OrderedDict implementation. (``object no longer
    exists``).

* MongoDB transport requires the ``findandmodify`` command only available in
  MongoDB 1.3+, so now raises an exception if connected to an incompatible
  server version.

* Virtual Transports: ``basic.cancel`` should not try to remove unknown
  consumer tag.

.. _version-1.0.4:

1.0.4
=====
:release-date: 2011-02-28 04:00 P.M CET

* Added Transport.polling_interval

    Used by django-kombu to increase the time to sleep between SELECTs when
    there are no messages in the queue.

    Users of django-kombu should upgrade to django-kombu v0.9.2.

.. _version-1.0.3:

1.0.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-02-12 04:00 P.M CET

* ConnectionPool: Re-connect if amqplib connection closed

* Adds ``Queue.as_dict`` + ``Exchange.as_dict``.

* Copyright headers updated to include 2011.

.. _version-1.0.2:

1.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-01-31 10:45 P.M CET

* amqplib: Message properties were not set properly.
* Ghettoq backend names are now automatically translated to the new names.

.. _version-1.0.1:

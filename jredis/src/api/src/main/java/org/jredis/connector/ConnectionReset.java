/**
 * This exception is thrown by a {@link Connection} to indicate that the connection to redis was
 * reset (typically due to timeout on Redis side).  
 * <p>
 * If the {@link Connection} is specified to use
 * auto-reconnect, the connection has been re-established, but, the status of the request that
 * gave rise to this exception is indeterminate, in the sense that while this exception certainly indicates
 * that the response was not received from Redis, it is not clear whether the request itself was
 * received by the server.  This is due to the fact that writing to the {@link OutputStream} of a {@link Socket}
 * that has been closed by the remote peer does NOT raise an exception.  The exception is raised (reliably) only
 * on the receive when reading from the {@link Socket}'s {@link InputStream}.
 * <p>
 * Depending on the application domain and the {@link Command} of the request, the user may retry 
 * the request.

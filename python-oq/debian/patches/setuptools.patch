+OpenQuake is an open source application that allows users to
+compute seismic hazard, seismic risk and socio-economic
+impact of earthquakes on a global scale.
+
+Please note: the /usr/bin/openquake script requires a celeryconfig.py
+file in the PYTHONPATH.  Please make sure this is the case and that your
+celeryconfig.py file works with your python-celery setup.
+Feel free to copy /usr/share/pyshared/openquake/celeryconfig.py and
+revise it as needed.

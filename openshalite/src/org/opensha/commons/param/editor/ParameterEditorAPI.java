/**
 * <b>Title:</b> ParameterEditorAPI
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Description:</b> Common interface functions that all implementing
 * ParameterEditors must implement so that they can be plugged transparently
 * into GUI frameworks.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This allows classes that use the ParameterEditors to deal with any Editor
 * type equally. Using this interface they all look the same. This permits new
 * editors to be added to the framework without changing the using classes.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note that all editors edit a Parameter. Internally they maintain a reference
 * to the particular parameter type they know how to handle.

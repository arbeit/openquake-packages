/**
 * <b>Title:</b> DoubleConstraint
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Description:</b> A doubleConstraint represents a range of allowed values
 * between a min and max double value, inclusive. The main purpose of this class
 * is to call isAllowed() which will return true if the value is withing the
 * range. Null values may or may not be allowed. See the ParameterConstraint
 * javadocs for further documentation.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note: It is up to the programmer using this class to ensure that the min
 * value is less than the max value. As an enhancement to this class setting min
 * and max could be validated that min is not greater than max.

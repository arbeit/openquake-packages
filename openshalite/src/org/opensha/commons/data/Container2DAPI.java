/**
 * <b>Title:</b> Container2DAPI
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Description:</b> Main interface that all 2D data containers must
 * implement. These provide functions for iteration through the elements,
 * replacing elements, etc. Each element is any object that extends Object.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This two dimensional grid acts more like a matrix than a geographical array
 * of location objects. You can store anything in each grid point. One of the
 * main purposes we use this class for is to store Location objects (latitude,
 * longitude) at each grid point. It just so happens that the location objects
 * are sorted spatially so that locations next to each other in real space are
 * next to each other in the grid. The confusing point is that even though the
 * grid is rectangular, the location objects may not map out to a rectangular
 * grid on the earth's surface at all. This is a fine point distintion but worth
 * noting due to confusion in designing this class.

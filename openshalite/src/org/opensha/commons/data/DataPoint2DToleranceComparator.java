/**
 * <b>Title:</b> DataPoint2DComparatorAPI
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Description:</b> Implementing comparator of DataPoint2d. The comparator
 * uses a tolerance to specify that when two values are within tolerance of each
 * other, they are equal
 * <p>
 * 
 * This class sounds more complicated that it really is. The whole purpose is
 * for calling the function compare(Object o1, Object o2). The x-coordinates are
 * obtained from each, then this algorythmn determines if the x-values are
 * equal:
 * <p>
 * 
 * Math.abs( x1 - x2 ) <= tolerance)
 * <p>
 * 
 * A tolerance=0 is actually abaout 1e-16 due to the numerical precision of
 * floating point arithmetic (1.0 + 1e-16 = 1.0 )
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note: In general comparators are created so that you can have more than one
 * sorting for a class. Imagine that you have a Javabean with 4 fields, id,
 * first name, last name, date created. Typical for a user record in a database.
 * Now you can build the compareTo() function inside this Javabean, nut then you
 * can only sort on 1 column. What if you present these javabeans in a GUI List,
 * and you want to sort on any field by clicking on the header. You simply make
 * 4 comparators, one for each field. Each header would use the particular
 * comparator for the sorting function. Very nice design pattern.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Now let's say you add another field. You simply make a new Comparator (
 * almost copy and paste). You don't have to change youre Javabean or your
 * sorting function. Just pass in this new comparator.
 * <p>

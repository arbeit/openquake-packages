/**
 * This class encapsulates information describing a vector between two
 * <code>Location</code>s. This vector is defined by the azimuth (bearing) from
 * a point p1 to a point p2, and also by the horizontal and vertical separation
 * between the points. Note that a <code>LocationVector</code> from point A to
 * point B is not the complement of that from point B to A. Although the
 * horizontal and vertical components will be the same, the azimuth will likely
 * change by some value other than 180&#176;.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Note:</b> Although a <code>LocationVector</code> will function in any
 * reference frame, the convention in seismology and that adopted in OpenSHA is
 * for depth to be positive down.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>Note:</b> Azimuth is stored internally in radians for computational
 * convenience. Be sure to use the {@link #getAzimuth()} (decimal-degrees) or
 * {@link #getAzimuthRad()} (radians) where appropriate.

     * included back azimuth. There are (were) instances in OpenSHA where this
     * was taken to be the azimuth from point B to A (for an azimuth from point
     * A to B). As Back azimuth is generally defined, this interp is incorrect.
     * Back azimuth is the 180 degree complement of the azimuth at an origin
     * point. Under the assumed interpretation, each LocationVector was
     * implicitely Location dependent, but that information was never stored as
     * part of this class. Furthermore, the onus was on the user to provide the
     * correct value for back azimuth. This property of the class has been
     * removed and users are directed in LocationUtils.azimuth() to simply
     * reverse the points of interest if the bearing from B to A is required.

     * getBackAzimuth could be readded (with clear docs) if necessary

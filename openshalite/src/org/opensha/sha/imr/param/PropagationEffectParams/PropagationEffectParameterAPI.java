/**
 * <p>
 * Title: PropagationEffectParameterAPI
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Description: Interface that PropagationEffect Parameters must implement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * Propagation Effect Parameters are a specific subclass of parameters that deal
 * with earthquake probability variables. Their defining characteristics are
 * that they take two independent variables, a Site and ProbEqkRupture and then
 * can calculate their own value. Their use is distinct from regular parameters
 * in that setValue() is typically not called. That is the only way to set
 * standard parameters.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This API defines several gatValue() functions that take different
 * combinations of Site and ProbEqkRupture that will make this parameter
 * recalculate itself, returning the new value.
 * <p>

     * Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero,
     * or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or
     * greater than the second. The implementor must ensure that sgn(compare(x,
     * y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x)) for all x and y. (This implies that compare(x,
     * y) must throw an exception if and only if compare(y, x) throws an
     * exception.) The implementor must also ensure that the relation is
     * transitive: ((compare(x, y)>0) && (compare(y, z)>0)) implies compare(x,
     * z)>0. Finally, the implementer must ensure that compare(x, y)==0 implies
     * that sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z)) for all z. It is generally
     * the case, but not strictly required that (compare(x, y)==0) ==
     * (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any comparator that violates this
     * condition should clearly indicate this fact. The recommended language is
     * "Note: this comparator imposes orderings that are inconsistent with
     * equals."
